"""Analysis engine for demonstrating tabletop segmentation using stored data.

This module provides an analysis engine that processes stored camera data to perform
tabletop segmentation. It reads data from MongoDB storage and applies a sequence of
annotators for image preprocessing and object detection.

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Reading stored camera data
2. Image preprocessing
3. Point cloud cropping
4. Plane detection
5. Point cloud cluster extraction

.. note::
    This demo uses the MongoDB storage interface and requires a properly configured
    MongoDB database with stored camera data.
